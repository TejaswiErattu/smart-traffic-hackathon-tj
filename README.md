# ðŸš¦ AI Multi-Agent System for Smart Traffic Management

A hackathon project to build an intelligent, real-time, event-driven traffic management system using AI-powered agents including smart traffic lights, vehicles, and drones.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion leads to wasted time, increased pollution, and inefficient emergency responses. Traditional static signal systems can't dynamically respond to real-time events.

**Goal:** Develop a multi-agent system where AI agents collaborate to:
- Dynamically adjust traffic signals
- Prioritize emergency vehicles
- Simulate rush hours, accidents, and roadblocks
- Optimize overall traffic flow with fairness and responsiveness

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **AsyncIO** â€“ for simulating real-time agent behavior
- **scikit-learn** â€“ to train and use an AI model for signal decisions
- **Joblib** â€“ for saving/loading the trained ML model
- **Pandas** â€“ to generate synthetic traffic training data
